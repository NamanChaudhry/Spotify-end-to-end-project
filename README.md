# Spotify-end-to-end-project
### Introduction
Python &amp; AWS automate Spotify data extraction &amp; analysis. Pandas, Lambda, S3, CloudWatch, Athena streamline ETL &amp; insights, enhancing data management.
### Description
This project is a comprehensive end-to-end solution for extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data from Spotify's APIs using Python on AWS infrastructure. Leveraging the power of Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, the data is meticulously processed and analyzed to derive meaningful insights. AWS Lambda functions automate the ETL process, while S3 serves as a reliable storage solution for the extracted data. CloudWatch monitors system health and performance, ensuring seamless execution. Athena enables ad-hoc querying and analysis of data stored in S3, facilitating rapid decision-making. Additionally, a schema creation tool enhances data organization and accessibility, streamlining the entire workflow. Overall, this project demonstrates the fusion of cutting-edge technologies to deliver actionable insights from Spotify's vast dataset, empowering informed decision-making and driving business growth.
